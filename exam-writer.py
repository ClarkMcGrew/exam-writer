## Expand all of the variable and mathematical expressions
#
# This takes an `input` string and a dictionary, `d`, and expands all
# of the values and mathematical expressions.  The dictionary should
# contain keys for all of the variables that are being replaced.
# Instances of &{name} are replaced inside the input string using the
# dictionary.  After all of the named variables are replaced, all
# instances of @{expr}, and @[sigfig]{expr} are expanded.
#
# Templates to be replace:
#
# - &{name} : Looks up `name` in the input dictionary and replaces
#         using that value.  For example if the dictionary contains
#         `{"spelling" : "yellow"}` an input string of "a &{spelling}
#         bee"  becomes "a yellow bee".
#
# - @{expr} : Applys eval to the expression (after all variables have
#         been expanded.  For instance, "@{1+1}" becomes "2"
#
# - @[sigfig]{expr} : After the expression has been evaluated, it is
#         rounded to the number of significant figures.  For instance,
#         "@[3]{1+1}" becomes "2.00".
#
# - @[sigfig(t|T)[expr] : Evaluate the expression and round the the
#         requested significant figures, then translate into a LaTeX
#         expression for the number in scientific notation.  For
#         example, "@[2t]{3E+8}" is "\ensuremath{3.0\times{}10^{8}}"
