# A sample exam template to build a set of LaTeX files for exams.  When the
# latex is generated there can be textual replacements
#
#  &{name} : Replace with a string value associated with name.  All
#                  substitutions happen before expressions are evaluated.
#
#  @{expression} : Evaluate the expression using python eval.  The
#                  expression must result in a string value.  The "@" is a
#                  reserved sigil in YAML, so it cannot begin anything that
#                  YAML will interpret as a token.  If YAML complains, you
#                  can use it in a string as (e.g. change @{1+1} to
#                  "@{1+1}", note the double quotes).  SAFETY NOTE: THE
#                  EXPRESSION CAN EXECUTE ARBITRARY PYTHON CODE, SO DO NOT
#                  USE INPUT FILES FROM AN UNTRUSTED SOURCE
#
#  @[num]{expression} : Evaluate the expression using python eval.  The
#                  expression must evaluate to a number, which will be
#                  rounded to num significant figures and printed in
#                  scientific format.  The "@" is a reserved sigil in YAML,
#                  so it cannot begin anything that YAML will interpret as
#                  a token.  If YAML complains, you can use it in a string
#                  as (e.g. change @{1+1} to "@{1+1}", note the double
#                  quotes). See the safety note above.

    Name: MoreQuestions01
    Text: |
      You're friend is trying to convince you that there is a relationship
      between mass ($m$), acceleration ($a$), velocity ($v$) and elapsed time
      ($t$) and a quantity they call the vibrancy (which is defined as mass
      times velocity squared).  Use dimensional analysis to decide which
      relation might be correct.
      
    Answers:
      A1:
        Correct: yes
        Text: $m a v t = m v^2$
      A2:
        Correct: no
        Text: $\frac{1}{2} m a t^2 = m v^2$
      A3:
        Correct: no
        Text: $m v t^2 = m v^2$
      A4:
        Correct: no
        Text: $m a x t = m v^2$
      A5:
        Correct: no
        After: all
        Text: None of the above.
        
    Solution: |
      The dimensions for each value are $[M]$ for mass, $[T]$ for time,
      $[L]/[T]$ for velocity and $[L]/[T]^2$ for acceleration.  So trying
      each possible answer:
      \begin{equation}
      m a v t = m v^2
      \rightarrow [M] \frac{[L]}{[T]^2} \frac{[L]}{[T]} [T]
      \equiv [M] \frac{[L]^2}{[T]^2} 
      \label{eq:q1answer}
      \end{equation}
    
      \begin{equation}
      \frac{1}{2} m a t^2 = m v^2
      \rightarrow [M] \frac{[L]}{[T]^2} [T]^2
      \not\equiv [M] \frac{[L]^2}{[T]^2} 
      \end{equation}

      \begin{equation}
      m v t^2 = m v^2
      \rightarrow [M] \frac{[L]}{[T]^2} [T]^2
      \not\equiv [M] \frac{[L]^2}{[T]^2} 
      \end{equation}
      
      \begin{equation}
      m a x t = m v^2
      \rightarrow [M] \frac{[L]}{[T]^2} [T]^2
      \not\equiv [M] \frac{[L]^2}{[T]^2} 
      \end{equation}

      So the solution is Equation~\ref{eq:q1answer}.

      You are told that the charge of an electron, $e$, has dimensions $[Q]$,
      and that a volt, $V$, has dimensions $\frac{[M][L^2]}{[Q][T]^2}$, the
      speed of light has dimensions $[L]/[T]$, and momentum has dimensions of
      $[M][L]/[T]$.  Use dimensional analysis to determine how to express the
      momentum in terms of $e$, $V$, and $c$.

    Solution: |
      The best way to try this is to figure out the dimensions of each case. 
      \begin{equation}
      \frac{e V}{c}
      \Rightarrow [Q] \frac{[M][L^2]}{[Q][T]^2} \frac{[T]}{[L]}
      = \frac{[M][L]}{[T]} 
      \equiv [M] \frac{[L]}{[T]} 
      \label{eq:q2answer}
      \end{equation}
      
      \begin{equation}
      \frac{e V}{c^2}
      \Rightarrow [Q] \frac{[M][L^2]}{[Q][T]^2} \frac{[T]^2}{[L]^2}
      = \frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^2} 
      \not\equiv [M] \frac{[L]}{[T]} 
      \end{equation}
      
      \begin{equation}
      e V c
      \Rightarrow [Q] \frac{[M][L^2]}{[Q][T]^2} \frac{[L]}{[T]}
      = \frac{[M][L]^3}{[T]^3} 
      \not\equiv [M] \frac{[L]}{[T]} 
      \end{equation}
      
      \begin{equation}
      e V
      \Rightarrow [Q] \frac{[M][L^2]}{[Q][T]^2}

      Estimate the number of cars per lane that are stuck on the LIE during
      rush hour.  Assume that the evening traffic coming out of the city on
      the LIE stretches for \qty{&{vDist}}{\kilo\meter}, and the average space
      between cars is \qty{&{vSpace}}{\meter}.

    Solution: |
      Since the distance between cars is \qty{&{vSpace}}{\meter}, the
      number of cars per meter is
      $\left(\frac{\qty{1}{car}}{\qty{&{vSpace}}{\meter}}\right)$.  Since
      the traffic stretchs for \qty{&{vDist}}{\kilo\meter} we can find the
      total number of cars

      \begin{equation}
      \left( \frac{\qty{&{vDist}}{\kilo\meter}}{\qty{1}{lane}} \right)
      \left( \frac{\qty{1000}{\meter}}{\qty{1}{\kilo\meter}} \right)
      \left( \frac{\qty{1}{car}}{\qty{&{vSpace}}{\meter}} \right)
      = \qty{@[2]{&{vDist}*1000.0/&{vSpace}}}{{cars}\per{}{lane}}.

      A person is running toward the back of a ship at
      \qty{&{vRun}}{\mps{}} and the ship is moving ahead with a velocity
      relative to the water of \qty{&{vShip}}{\mps{}}.  What speed is the person

    Solution: |
      Choose the ship as the reference frame, and define the forward
      direction as positive.  In this case, the person is running with a
      velocity of $v_p = -\qty{&{vRun}}{\mps{}}$ relative to the ship.  The
      velocity of the ship relative to the water is $v_s =
      \qty{&{vShip}}{\mps{}}$, so the persion is traveling at $v'_p = v_p +
      v_s = \qty{&{vRun}}{\mps{}} + \qty{&{vShip}}{\mps{}} =
      \qty{@{-&{vRun}+&{vShip}}}{\mps{}}$ relative to the water.

    Solution: |
      Choosing the coordinate system for the water to point in the
      direction the first ship is traveling, the velocity of the first ship
      relative to the water is $v_a = &{vAShip}\mps{}$, the velocity of the
      second ship is $v_b = - &{vBShip}\;\mps{}$.  In the frame of the
      first ship, the velocity of the second ship will be $v_{ba} = v_b -
      v_a = @{-&{vBShip} - &{vAShip}}\;\mps{}$.  The velocity of the first
      person in the reference frame of the first ship is $v_{1a} = -
      &{vRun}$, and the velocity of the second person the second ship is
      $v_{2b} = &{vRun}$.  The velocity of the second persion relative to
      the first ship will be $v_{2a} = -v_{2b} + v_{ab} = @{-&{vRun} -
      &{vBShip} - &{vAShip}}\mps{}$.  Finally, the velocity of the second
      person relative to the first person is $v_{21} = v_{2a} - v_{1a} =
      @{-&{vRun} - &{vBShip} - &{vAShip} + &{vRun}}\;\mps{}$.  The speed is
      $|v_{21}| = @{abs(-&{vRun} - &{vBShip} - &{vAShip} +
      &{vRun})}\;\mps{}$.

      A certain object is accelerating at $a = \alpha t$ for times larger

    Answers:
      A1:
        Correct: yes

      A2:
        Correct: no
        Text: $v = v_o + \alpha$
      A3:
        Correct: no

      A5:
        Correct: no
        After: all
        Text: None of the above.
    
    Solution: |
      Since the acceleration is
      \begin{equation}
      a = \frac{d v}{dt} \Leftrightarrow dv = a dt
      \Leftrightarrow
      v = \int a dt = \int \alpha t dt = v_o + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2
      \end{equation}
      where the constant of integration is $v_o$.
